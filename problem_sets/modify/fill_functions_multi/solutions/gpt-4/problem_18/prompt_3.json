The principal axis of a contour is the line that best fits the contour points. Each contour is represented as a list of points, where each point is a list of two integers representing the x and y coordinates. The function should return the absolute difference in the average distances of the contour points from the principal axis for the two contours.\n\nFunction Signature:\nprincipal_axis_alignment_comparison(contour1: List[List[int]], contour2: List[List[int]]) -> float\n\nInput Code:\nimport numpy as np\nimport cv2\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef principal_axis_alignment_comparison(contour1: List[List[int]], contour2: List[List[int]]) -> float:\n    def alignment_distance(contour):\n        # Fit a line to the contour points and calculate average distance\n        # A line of code is missing here\n        return avg_distance\n    alignment1 = alignment_distance(contour1)\n    alignment2 = alignment_distance(contour2)\n    return abs(float(alignment1) - float(alignment2))",
